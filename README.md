# Logger.NET

Logger.NET is a C# logging library designed to offer efficient and customizable logging capabilities for applications, providing both console and file logging functionality.

## Features

- **Console Logging:** Supports logging messages to the console with customizable colors based on different log levels (info, warning, error), enhancing readability and enabling quick identification of log messages.
- **File Logging:** Provides asynchronous file logging, allowing developers to persist log messages to a file for debugging and troubleshooting purposes. The library efficiently handles concurrent log writes and batches log messages to reduce file I/O operations and improve performance.
- **Efficiency:** Implements asynchronous programming techniques and concurrent data structures to ensure efficient logging operations without blocking the main thread, minimizing performance overhead and maintaining application responsiveness.
- **Simplicity:** Designed for simplicity and ease of use, Logger.NET provides a simple API for integrating logging functionality into C# applications with minimal effort, making it accessible to developers of all skill levels.
